# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Adversarial

CS420 Machine Learning

##Main idea

We have tried diï¬€erent methods to deal with the project, including CNN+Facial landmarks+HOG, ResNet18 and VGG19. The highest accuracy can reach to 73.11% in private test. Afterwards, we use Fast Gradient Sign Method to attack VGG19, resulting in the accuracy dropping to 21.12%. Then, we conduct the adversarial training, raising the accuracy to 33.60%.
