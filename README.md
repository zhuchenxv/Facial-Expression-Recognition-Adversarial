# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Adversarial

## About

This is the course project of CS420 Machine Learning, SJTU. We have tried diï¬€erent methods to deal with the project, including CNN+Facial_landmarks+HOG, ResNet18 and VGG19. The highest accuracy can reach to 73.11% in private test. Afterwards, we use Fast Gradient Sign Method to attack VGG19, resulting in the accuracy dropping to 21.12%. Then, we conduct the adversarial training, raising the accuracy to 33.60%.

## Getting started

### CNN+Facial_landmarks+HOG

#### * Prerequisites

  * Download the dataset (fer2013.csv)
  * Download the Face Landmarks model (Dlib Shape Predictor model)

#### Convert the dataset to extract Face Landmarks and HOG Features

  ```
  python convert_fer2013_to_images_and_landmarks.py
  ```

#### Train the model

* Choose the parameters in 'parameters.py'

* Optimize training hyperparameters.

  ```
  python optimize_hyperparams.py --max_evals=20
  ```

* Launch training

  ```
  python train.py --train=yes
  ```
### ResNet18 and VGG19

#### Prerequisites

* Download the dataset (fer2013.csv)

* Preprocess the data

  ```
  python preprocess_fer2013.py
  ```

#### Train the model

* Launch training

  ```
  python mainpro_FER.py --model VGG19 --bs 128 --lr 0.01
  ```

  You can also use different parameters incluing model (VGG19, ResNet18), batch size and learning rate.
  
### Adversarial Attack and Adversarial Training

#### Adversarial Attack

Use a FGSM model to generate adversarial examples for each epoch. Each sample in test set generate one adversarial example. Then we use our VGG 19 model to predict these adversarial examples and compute the accuracy.

#### Adversarial Training

When we train our VGG 19 model, we consider both training set and the adversarial set generated from training set. And then we test our model in each epoch.
